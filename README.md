# Stockprediction

In this project we predicted stock price using a time-series model known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM models are powerful especially for retaining a long-term memory. It is artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It cannot only process single data points such as images but also entire sequences of data. This characteristic is extremely useful when we deal with Time-Series or Sequential Data. When using an LSTM model, we are free and able to decide what information will be stored and what discarded. From this experiment, we can conclude that recurrent neural networks are very useful and perform with great accuracy in predicting time series data. LSTM networks specifically worked very well in this case because LSTMs are very powerful in learning long term dependencies and co-relations in the observed data. Even though stock prices are very unpredictable, there are still some hidden relationships in the data. With proper tweak to the LSTM network, we can make the model accurately mimic the actual hidden relations in the data. We tried predicting stock prices for Apple Inc. for future dates.
